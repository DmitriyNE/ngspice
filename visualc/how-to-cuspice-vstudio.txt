ngspice may be compiled by MS Visual Studio Community 2017
 (or 2019 in Visual Studio 2017 mode).

For compilation you need the GNU bison parser generator.

A ready for windows compiled variant can be downloaded as
  win_flex_bison-latest.zip
from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/files/

Create the directory
  ../../flex-bison
relative from this directory right here, and unzip there.

We will invoke the win_bison.exe file
 in this directory during the visual studio compilation.

Install CUDA
(tested with CUDA 10.1 from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

Only valid for Visual Studio 2017 and CUDA 10.1.
Will compile in 64 bit version only.
VS 2019 tested if in VS 2017 mode.

XSPICE and CIDER are not supported.
fftw is not yet supported.
OpenMP is not yet supported (It will compile, but ngspice.exe segfaults).
Shared ngspice with CUDA is (not yet) supported.

Visual Studio is started by double click on cuspice.sln.
Select 'Build' 'Configuration Manager' and then choose one
of the build options, e.g. 'Active solution configuration'
with its Debug or Release GUI versions or the
equivalent console version (no GUI, no graphical interface),
and 'Active solution platform', only available with 'x64',
that is 64 bit code.

Selection of 'Build' and then 'Rebuild solution' will build
complete ngspice, starting with CUDA, where nvcc.exe is used
to compile the CUDA files named *.cu, and afterwards all
other files are compiled and ngspice.exe is generated. Finally
make-install-vngspice.bat is called to copy ngspice.exe,
spinit into a directory tree, that resembles the one
generated by mingw 'make install'. An example tree is given
below.

C:\Spice64\
    bin\
        ngspice.exe
        vcomp140.dll
    share\
        ngspice
            scripts\
                spinit

C:\Spice64\ may be renamed to any folder which offers 
rights for read and write to ngspice.
If spinit is not found in the directory cited above,
ngspice.exe also searches for spinit in its own directory.
