	* spdefs.h: #includes spice.h instead of misc.h
	added a few #undefs to avoid redaclarations

spAllocate.c:
	ReserveElements() not needed
	Distinction between OriginalCount() and ElementCount() needed for ACCT report.
	Structure Matrix has no "Original" member anymore, seems ELEMENTS plays this role.
spBuild.c:
	int Min is initialized with LARGEST_LONG_INTEGER follows in -1, Min should be long int
spSMP.c:
	Return value of SMP functions: what is meant for spError? the typedef to int or the spErrorState function?
	SMPfindElt() calls spcFindElement() - it is not available
	Compiling with spSEPARATED_COMPLEX_VECTORS=0 follows in error like this:
spSMP.c: In function ‘SMPcSolve’:
spSMP.c:222:5: error: too many arguments to function ‘spSolve’
  222 |     spSolve( (char *)Matrix, RHS, RHS, iRHS, iRHS );
      |     ^~~~~~~
In file included from spSMP.c:93:
../../../src/include/ngspice/spmatrix.h:371:23: note: declared here
  371 | spcEXTERN  void       spSolve( spMatrix, spREAL[], spREAL[] );

This shows that prototypes are OK, but in the call of the function is no difference in parameter count.
