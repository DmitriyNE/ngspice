use utf-8 for encoding of strings, this enables UNICODE
international characters sets (of nearly any language)
in titles, labels, file and folder names.

Windows uses utf-16 and conversion function between utf-8
and utf-16, if access to Windows API functions is needed.
A special fopen has been defined.

In addition, plot labels on the y axis now are placed
vertically, 90Â°, by using WWindows API or Linux Xft library.

Postscript plotting uses only a UNICODE subset, t.b.d..

Better looking fonts are now used for labelling.
